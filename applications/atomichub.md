### Project Details

The goal of this project is to bring the full functionality of the AtomicHub marketplace to the Proton blockchain. We believe this will create a robust opportunity for NFTs on Proton, effecting a step-change in both discoverability and production of NFT projects within the broader Proton ecosystem.

We are established and committed Proton block producers, as well as creators of the AtomicAsset NFT standard. Together, these credentials demonstrate both our commitment to Proton, and our technical capability to deliver a leading NFT marketplace for the Proton blockchain community. We believe that evolving AtomicHub to include full Proton capabilities will add new dimensions to both AtomicHub and Proton marketplace. The result should be a gradual and then accelerating awareness of Proton, consideration of Proton as a viable blockchain for NFT projects, and adoption of Proton as a blockchain of choice for businesses utilising NFT technology and payments.

By launching AtomicHub on the Proton blockchain, we will provide creators, collectors, and gamers with a world-class user-friendly platform that will act as a gateway to NFTs on Proton. Users will be able to mint their own NFTs, and utilise a secondary marketplace with trading, buy and sell offers, gift links, and auctions. We will provide a curated experience to showcase the highest-quality art collections and game projects. 

In order to support Proton users, we plan to integrate the WebAuth wallet to expand our crypto-fiat support. To date, AtomicHub utilises Anchor (WAX/EOS), Wombat Wallet (EOS), and MyCloudWallet (WAX). Initially, we will launch AtomicHub on Proton with Anchor wallet sign-in, as we already support Anchor.

The WebAuth Wallet is a noncustodial wallet developed by Metallicus which enables users to have complete control over their assets within a beautiful and intuitive mobile UI. Once AtomicHub is implemented on the Proton blockchain, we will then focus on integrating the WebAuth wallet as an alternative log-in method to Anchor wallet. 

### Ecosystem Fit

We view NFT technology as one of the most obviously valuable innovations that blockchain technology brings - Enabling true digital ownership for the first time. We expect that NFT based projects, e.g. gaming or collectibles projects, or other innovations we haven’t even contemplated, will have a leading impact in shaping the web3 landscape and mainstream entertainment in the years to come.

AtomicAssets, a NFT standard that AtomicHub’s founders built in 2019, has over the last four years become widely adopted within the Antelope ecosystem. It has since been established as the go-to standard for NFTs. More than 370MM NFTs have been created by more than 2,500 whitelisted (checked by us to ensure quality and originality standards) collections on the WAX and EOS blockchains alone. AtomicAssets is used by some of the biggest dAPPs (e.g. AlienWorlds / Splinterlands) in the world and some of the biggest brands (e.g. Topps MLB, Funko). It has been interacted with by millions of users to-date.

AtomicHub already has 2.5MM connected wallets on our platform, predominantly WAX customers but also over 20,000 EOS customers. We also plan to launch Immutable X in the near term. By adding the Proton blockchain, we allow the easy cross-reference, organic discovery and intentional targeting by CRM and marketing from customers/users on other blockchains on AtomicHub to Proton as a blockchain, as well as Proton projects specifically as they redeem themselves on their merits. This uniquely positions us within the Antelope ecosystem as the #1 blockchain business with a potential to create an inflection point in the adoption of Proton for NFTs.

### Milestones

### Milestone 1 — Launch AtomicHub Secondary Market on Proton & Integrate WebAuth Wallet to AtomicHub

- **Estimated duration:** 3 months
- **FTE:**  1
- **Costs:** 125,000 USD

| ID | Deliverable | Specification |
| ----- | ----------- | ------------- |
| 1. | Implement AtomicMarket smart contract  | Launching the AtomicMarket contract on Proton through AtomicHub will enable Atomic Asset sales, auctions, and buyoffers |
| 2. | Trading | A dedicated trading section for Atomic Assets on Proton will be launched on the platform to enable a trustless system to create and accept buy or trade offers with $XPR and (as appropriate) other fiat, native crypto and stablecoin payment methods.   |
| 3. | Social Features| A friends system will be launched to enable users to easily track and trade with trusted wallets. User profiles will be able to link to external social media platforms including Twitter, Discord, Youtube, Twitch. A centralised messaging feature will be enabled in the future to allow for messaging across user profiles. |
| 4. | Badge System | A system to check collections will be implemented that screens for originality of Atomic Assets and we will perform KYC and KYB checks for collection owners.  |
| 5. | Product parity | We will aim to achieve near-product parity between WAX, EOS & Proton to ensure near-equal standing and technical representation on the platform between these three Antelope blockchains. Note some features, like carbon offsets, may not be available on all blockchains. |
| 6. | Legal and Technical Investigation |  We will perform a legal and technical investigation as to how best to implement the Metallicus products to the marketplace. We have a dedicated legal expert on our team that will ensure we are compliant when and if we launch these features. Our development team will assess how to best implement the WebAuth wallet MetalPay API. | 
| 7. | WebAuth Wallet Integration |  Subject to approvals, we intend to incorporate the WebAuth wallet as a log-in option to AtomicHub, giving users the option to log-in to the platform through Anchor Wallet or WebAuth Wallet. | 
| 8. | MetalPay API Integration | MetalPay is a financial application that allows for the purchase of cryptocurrencies directly with fiat and is currently supported in 46 states within the USA and 30 countries across the world. Subject to approvals, we intend to incorporate MetalPay API to our platform as an option for users to be able to purchase the XPR necessary to transact on the marketplace. |

### Future Plans

Our success as a company relies on the wide adoption of NFT technology, in particular on our "home" (Antelope). With AtomicHub being the leading NFT marketplace across EOS and WAX, we believe that it is logical and in our best interest to expand to Proton. As we continue into 2023 and beyond, we plan to achieve the milestones laid out in this proposal and build stronger partnerships in the Proton ecosystem. As the financial tools develop on the “Payments Blockchain”, we see the development of a closer relationship between our company and Proton. 

### Additional Information

External funding has come from WAX in 2020 through a grant of $10K for the creation of AtomicAssets. Our team has also received a $100K Recognition Grant in 2021 from the EOS Network Foundation. Otherwise, no external funding has been used to capitalise the business to-date since the initial seed capital from the founders.
