### Project Details

Fishtank DAO is a decentralised ecosystem built by Fishtank Labs, Inc. targeted towards startups and scaling businesses. It will consist of decentralised solutions. It will be supported by proprietary solutions as well as a set of digital services around that to help support businesses throughout their lifecycle - particularly in the early phase and growth phase. These will be provided by Fishtank Labs, Inc. (core developer).

The decentralised ecosystem is to consist of a project launchpad, dashboard with referrals and staking mechanism, an NFT minting launchpad for campaigns, pool-based fundraising for startups so that rewards are used for capital raising (similar to the ISPO model seen on Cardano), a discovery tool to find investors and contractors to help with the work, and other solutions in the future to support businesses and the problems they're facing throughout their lifecycle.

What is the current status?

In scope of this ask:

* Launchpad - we have already started development (completed designs can be seen here: https://www.figma.com/proto/9xWUmdCyI0PKGfa6qqZnGl/Fishtank-DAO-Web-App?page-id=3442%3A331128&type=design&node-id=3587-343801&viewport=-7137%2C-11727%2C0.25&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=3481%3A343095)
* NFT Minting Launchpad - currently in design with a target release of Q1 2024 to support (design in progress here: https://www.figma.com/proto/9xWUmdCyI0PKGfa6qqZnGl/Fishtank-DAO-Web-App?page-id=4094%3A387353&type=design&node-id=4094-387362&viewport=-9108%2C-28668%2C0.5&scaling=min-zoom)

Additional:

* Fishtank Labs Website - designs almost complete with go-live expected in Q3 2023 (design in progress here: https://www.figma.com/proto/9xWUmdCyI0PKGfa6qqZnGl/Fishtank-DAO-Web-App?page-id=4144%3A378985&node-id=4256-383584&viewport=737%2C-200%2C0.33&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=4256%3A383584)
* Fishtank Website - almost ready to go live with updated format and content targeting startups (https://www.fishtank.ai)
* Fishtank Nodes - going live officially from June 1st with a ~600k bond of METAL until end of year (to then move to annual cycle in line with tax season)


### Ecosystem Fit

#### Where and how does your project fit into the Proton ecosystem?

1. We can help vetted and KYC'd projects launch and raise capital to get started - including those looking to build on Proton and Metal
2. Community members will be able to back projects they believe in using various methods
3. Fishtank and other digital service providers in the Proton ecosystem will be able to showcase their capabilities to businesses
4. Projects will raise in $XMD promoting the stablecoin used in the ecosystem and it's benefits
5. We can easily showcase why Proton/WebAuth are better (protonkyc.com, DID, Secure Enclave etc.)
6. It helps bring exposure to Proton Loan which startups can use to increase their financial runway (adoption incentive)
7. There's an active NFT community and we will help bring minting bespoke vetted collections to Proton
8. We will expose ProtonDEX Swap frontend through our solution which will help build liquidity
9. Transformation service offering helping Web2 companies become Web3 businesses and tokenise on Proton (where it can add value)

#### Who is your target audience?

1. Startups and scaling businesses - you can see full fledged service offering on the Fishtank Labs website design

Funds only to be released upon successful completion of the Project Launchpad milestone above.

Note: This is not a competitor to Soon. This is targeted for specific collections for businesses/creators to launch marketing campaigns in an affordable manner - this could be a bespoke collection of art, or even a set of utility NFTs tied to a project launch to build hype.


### Future Plans

The launchpads are central/critical to our digital services offering so we will enhance them with gamification capabilities, referral systems, etc. to enhance loyalty and also increase participation in the fundraises. Ultimately, we only raise capital ourselves from these launchpads if the projects we support do well as our revenue on these is % based.

We are already positioning ourselves as serving projects cross-chain. While incentivising building on Proton by providing discounts on fundraises to those that commit to building on Proton, we are far more likely to be successful if we're open minded and work with the wider crypto industry. They will still need to download WebAuth wallet as part of the onboarding process to be vetted/KYC'd and therefore exposed to the ecosystem.

We also run multiple nodes on METAL and will be focusing on growing our community base on Twitter a lot more from June 1st 2023 onwards. This increases our chance of not just survival but our ability to thrive moving forward. Other launchpads aren't really operating in a compliant manner or trying to do so as well. In the future, METAL node revenue can be reinvested to support development.

We will be launching an ETH based token on Uniswap in the future to capture the attention of the massive Ethereum community, and then look to bridge that back in the same way Proton was initially. This is a common strategic move by many projects and we think this is the best way to grow our community base quickly.

We are already in discussions with exchanges about token listings which will bring about increased awareness and exposure.

It's also important to note a huge proportion of our revenue will come from the services we offer around our products increasing our chances of survival - these include branding and creative, engineering, consulting, and transformation. We have contacts in this space and aim to become a member of the Startup Grind community actively involved in promoting the message of Web3 in general - this is another channel where Proton/Metal can gain a lot of exposure.


### Additional Information

1. We are willing to showcase other Proton builders on our website here as businesses that can provide services for startups/scaling businesses (consulting, creative, engineering, NFT launches, etc.)
2. We will donate 5.12m FSH to the Proton Community warchest if this grant proposal is passed (2% of total supply - to be 256m) - this will be paid out over a three year period via streaming payment to avoid a mass token dump (the same rule will apply for core team member token allocations)
3. We are open to Consortium members reaching out to join our vetting council on projects to ensure only the best build on Proton
4. We are open to donations in the future to give back to the Proton ecosystem

In short, as we have started building already, this is an opportunity for the community/Consortium to back us and partner with Fishtank. Given the benefits we can bring for other builders in the ecosystem, and the 5.12m token donation, we believe this leads to a win:win situation for all involved - us, the Consortium, and most importantly the community.

In full disclosure and transparency, we want to outline the cost of not receiving the grant:

* No 5.12m FSH token donation to the Proton warchest
* No possibility of donations on revenue earned in the future
* No strong marketing of Proton ecosystem - we will shift our positioning to cross-chain while leveraging the Proton tech in the same way businesses use AWS, GCP, etc.
* No showcasing of other service providers to startups in our network
* No Fishtank fund for those looking to build on Proton
* No open sourcing of our solutions 1 year after their launch date (everything will stay closed-source)

In short, we can do this without the grant but in that case there'd be zero ROI potential for Proton. We believe any engagement/relationship has to be mutually beneficial for all involved and we simply cannot invest/give a lot with little/zero in return. We are open to giving but it has to be a two-way thing. We believe our offer is fair and we're willing to give up a significant amount of our tokens to minimise the risk Proton is exposed to.

Our recommendation would also be to use any potential ROI from these tokens to spin up Proton Community METAL nodes as revenue streams that can pay back into the warchest moving forward. Although, this is only a suggestion on how the funds could be used.
