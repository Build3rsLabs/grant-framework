### Project Details

> BlastPad is a project-launching platform created exclusively for the Proton blockchain ecosystem. BlastPad will consist of 4 independent domains coming together on 1 consolidated platform, enabling the individual sites to be used separately or all together. 
The “home page” would be https://blastpad.io/ and the intent here would be to have a very modern design with video and a cutting-edge presentation detailing the process of creating a token, doing the airdrop, and then allowing holders to stake the token. The plan is to have all of these features on 1 easy to use platform. 
The Domains for this project:
+ https://blastpad.io/
+ https://tokencreate.io/ 
+ https://airdropperpro.com/ 
+ https://dailystake.io/ 

The token creation page will be https://tokencreate.io/ and the idea would be a front end, easy to use, platform where non-tech savvy creators can create a token on the Proton blockchain very simply by answering some questions and uploading a token design. 
The next part of the platform is the airdropping portion. The page we will be using is https://airdropperpro.com/ and will be an easy to use, but highly functional, air dropping platform. We have created filters that can be used to qualify users for token air drops. An example of these filters would be “Air Drop to users that hold (At least 1000) (XPR) for at least (90) days”. The ( ) represents the filters that can be modified to limit the tokens of the air drop to a targeted group of users. Next, we have included 2 forms of Air Drop. 
- 1.	Airdrop Push – In this instance, the airdrop is pushed out to all users that qualify for the drop. The token creator would filter for receivers, and then depending on the number that will be dropped to, pay for RAM, and send out the airdrop. 
- 2.	Airdrop Claim – the token creator would filter for qualified receivers, and set a number of days (such as 90) that the claim would be open for these accounts to go to airdropperpro.com, log in, and claim the airdrop. This instance would not require the sender to pay for RAM. 
- 3.	The fourth page with an independent URL will be https://dailystake.io/ which is a staking platform open to all token creators, to give them a central location to offer staking on their token. Our intention is to have multiple tokens on the page, all offering their desired interest rate. On this page we will also offer a “bonus pool” which will be an additional pool of every token being staked, and will be a bonus given daily to stakers of the BlastPad token. 


### Ecosystem Fit

- 1.	Where and how does your project fit into the Proton ecosystem? Our project fits nicely into the existing Proton ecosystem, as currently there is no easy way to create a token, airdrop it, and allow users to stake it. Our goal is to grow the Proton ecosystem and Proton users by allowing easy front-end options with no coding needed. 
- 2.	Who is your target audience? Our target audience is huge, and will include any new token project and any entrepreneur that wants to launch a project on Proton blockchain. There are massive existing hurdles that this platform will eliminate. 
- 3.	What needs does your project meet for the community and what sets it apart from other similar projects? There is a glaring need for a front-end easy-to-use project launch pad. There are no existing projects that are tackling these obstacles and we see many new users coming into the Proton ecosystem because of this project launch pad.

### Roadmap

> Our roadmap for Blastpad consists of 4 Milestones over a 3 month period, which will allow us to release the individual domains and advertise each one as the building continues 

### Milestones

- **Milestone:** 1
- **Estimated duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:**  5
- **Costs:** 36,000 USD

to include $32,000 in development costs and $4,000 in advertising with emphasis on Proton Blockchain. This cost is inclusive of all past and prior website, coding, and smart contract work. 
0a. License – We intend to release under the MIT
0b: Documentation – we will include documentation on how to use the product and the tokenomics on the website for the closed end product. Api documentation delivered in the Repository ReadMe along with installation and use examples.
0c: Front end – Interface delivery and login functionality will be delivered in the Repository 
0d: Back end – The majority of the development work and smart contract work is complete and we are currently in the testing phase. 
Milestone 1 to be considered complete with a fully functioning platform with the 5 escrow types. Independent operation of separate modules to be completed in MS2

- **Milestone:** 2
- **Estimated duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:**  2
- **Costs:** 12,000 USD

to include $8,000 in development costs and $4,000 in advertising, with emphasis on Proton Blockchain
0a: Completion and full testing of the UX / UI with an example website online. 
0b: Proton Webauth integration is complete and functionable with all 5 escrow types without requiring all to be installed. 
0c: Complete the separation and independent operation of the 5 escrow types such that they are installable independently. 
0d: Create installer script to lower the bar for installation by developers.
Milestone 2 to be considered complete when all 5 escrow modules have been split and are running independently, and are open source, with full documentation, available to the public. 



### Future Plans

> How do you intend to enhance, promote and support your project in the future? Our team is full-time and growing. We are builders and we are constantly improving our platforms and adding more services and better functions. We plan to release our closed end platform and begin immediately advertising it through paid socials, with the goal of bringing thousands of users into the Proton ecosystem. 4 weeks later we will release our open source modules and promote those to developers. We plan to continue to build on Proton and support our products and services. 

### Additional Information

> We have never received a grant from Proton in the past. We are actively involved in the Proton community and believe in their vision for mainstream adoption. We currently run 3 metal nodes, run 3 dedicated servers, and have built a loan liquidator bot. We are actively working on an airdrop platform, a staking platform, and a token creation platform. We have plans after that for a web3 photography site and a travel site, both on Proton blockchain. We will then use the smart contract knowledge from these platforms to integrate into our real estate search platform.
