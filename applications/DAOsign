### Project Details

DAOsign offers a decentralized, cryptographic solution that allows DAOs to create, sign, and verify agreements with authorized proofs-of-signature, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of their contracts.
With our platform's extensible Agreement Management System, workstream automation, and Smart Contracts integration, as well as our flexible Signer Identity Verification System and NFT-based Signer Authority Verification System, DAOsign provides a reliable and efficient way for DAOs to manage their agreements.

DAOsign addresses the need for a secure and transparent way to sign, manage and automate agreements of all kinds with a configurable level of anonymity disclosure.
Traditional methods of signing agreements, such as paper-based systems or legacy e-signatures, are prone to fraud and lack transparency and offer no solution for verifying the signer's identity or authority to execute the agreement. Instead, these systems rely on costly legal proceedings to enforce agreements. 
DAOsign combines proof-of-agreement, proof-of-signature and proof-of-authority into a publicly verifiable cryptographic proof enabling secure, transparent, and automated processing of complex agreements and smart contracts. 

### Ecosystem Fit

Our project fits into the Proton ecosystem by providing an agreement-signing tool that leverages the capabilities and infrastructure of Proton. DAOsign can integrate with Proton's blockchain technology and identity management solutions, enabling secure and decentralized execution of agreements within the ecosystem. By utilizing Proton's robust network, our tool enhances the efficiency, transparency, and reliability of agreement execution, contributing to the growth and adoption of Proton as a leading blockchain platform for identity and financial services. This integration strengthens the overall value proposition of the Proton ecosystem, offering users a seamless and secure solution for managing agreements in various industries and use cases.

DAOsign addresses the needs of the community by providing a user-friendly, secure, and decentralized solution for managing agreements. It enhances efficiency, transparency, and autonomy, empowering community members to conduct their agreements with greater ease and confidence. As for similar projects, we prepared a competitive landscape, which you can see in our pitch deck, I'm attaching: https://docsend.com/view/sbexkxn5su3ahdg8
