### Project Details

> Describe your project in detail, include any screenshots or designs. What problem does it solve? What is the current state of the project? 

Scorefam is the first blockchain risk-profiled sport gaming platform that enables fans to earn their own way and invest in sport events with a 
no-loss gaming model which aims to create more earning opportunities and increase fan engagement.    

Scorefam aims to solve the problem of limited flexibility and control in sports gaming platforms by introducing risk profiling. 
It addresses the frustration experienced by users with a low risk tolerance who seek a betting experience that aligns with their 
preferences and provides more options to manage their bets effectively.

The project is currently live on the BSC chain and we have processed a transactional volume of over $750,000+ since the release of the MVP in May 2022 with a total user base 
of over 12,000 users and a revenue of $130,000+


### Ecosystem Fit

> 1. Where and how does your project fit into the Proton ecosystem?

Smart Contract Betting: Proton's blockchain utilizes smart contracts. These could be programmed to automatically execute bets when certain conditions are met, reducing the need for middlemen. This would make betting more efficient and reduce the potential for disputes.

Identity Verification: Proton allows for the integration of verified identities. This feature will be used by scorefam platform to ensure users are of legal betting age and are not in a jurisdiction where sports betting is illegal.

Transparency: The transparency of blockchain transactions would help prevent fraudulent activity and ensure fair play. Bets and outcomes would be recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent history that anyone could check.

Payment Processing: The project will leverage Proton's ability to facilitate transactions in both cryptocurrency and fiat currency. This would provide bettors with more payment options.

> 2. Who is your target audience?
- Crypto Enthusiast
- Sport bettors
- Gamblers
- Gamers
- Sport fans

> 3. What needs does your project meet for the community and what sets it apart from other similar projects?

Risk Profiling for Users: Scorefam introduces a sophisticated risk profiling system that allows users to personalize their betting experience based on their individual risk tolerance. By offering a variety of betting options and gaming models, users can choose the ones that align with their preferred level of risk. 

Sports-Based Investment Opportunities: Scorefam goes beyond traditional betting options by offering sports-based investment opportunities. Users can invest their capital in gaming events, and if their predictions are correct, they earn yields on their investment. This solution allows users to participate in sports gaming while minimizing the risk of losing their capital.
