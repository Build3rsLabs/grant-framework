### Project Details

Fishtank is a decentralised careers and talent ecosystem being built by Fishtank Labs, Inc.

Our vision and mission is to build a DApp on the Proton Blockchain that enables professionals to find job opportunities, and businesses to find the best talent. Additionally, by leveraging the WebAuth wallet and onchain KYC, we can build out a verified talent pool of professionals providing both quantity and quality to businesses.

The core problems we aim to minimise and/or solve are the following:

* Recruitment fraud - this is estimated to be a global problem costing $0.5trn - 0.75trn per year
* Expectations mismatch - this leads to a loss of money/time for both businesses and professionals
* Freedom/ownership - finance is changing and to be truly free, we need a global working culture to match it
* Costs - current talent/workforce solutions are fragmented and expensive - not configurable, modular, and affordable
* Integrated financial use cases - by leveraging crypto, the blockchain and WebAuth, we can offer differentiators (NFTs, etc.)
* Governance - tokenisation will enable us to allow users to be more involved in what features get added moving forward

Here you can find a link to the DApp designs in Figma: [Click Here - 4 prototype flows](https://www.figma.com/proto/9xWUmdCyI0PKGfa6qqZnGl/Fishtank-DAO-Web-App?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=293-81017&viewport=220%2C360%2C0.02&scaling=contain&starting-point-node-id=1820%3A139283&show-proto-sidebar=1)

We have currently made very good progress with the designs and are now in a position where we're looking to onboard a full-time developer initially to start building, before adding another developer later to support them.

In addition, the new fishtank.ai website is due to go live end of April 2023 with a focus on content and community to support adoption of Fishtank and the entire ecosystem - this will help drive awareness of what we're looking to achieve.

User --> website (fishtank.ai) --> DApp (app.fishtank.ai)

We already have fishtankjobs.com live - long-term aim is DApp will replace this.

Whitepaper: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tq6roVws1If8m5NpcxDiAl152S-4LRBjqjAOZ64uTIA/edit#

Note: Fishtank will all be one platform DApp with modules, with a community based website in front of it, and later an NFT market to support marketing efforts. We initially were going to have two apps but this doesn't make sense. All will be decentralised.


### Ecosystem Fit

1. Talent ecosystem and network that can be used by the community, and governed by them via tokenisation
2. Job seekers/professionals (B2C) and businesses looking to source global talent (B2B)
3. Nobody else is really trying to do this elsewhere in this way, and the potential is huge given the problems we're aiming to reduce/solve. We can help bring more people into the Proton ecosystem as a whole, and show that we can have a global talent network governed by the very people who build and make our world what it is. Additionally, we can onboard businesses in the space, and due to us wanting to take a configurable and modular approach, we could potentially extend this out later with an API where developers elsewhere in the community can come and build modules that compliment the overall mission (similar to what Shopify have done with commerce).

### Milestones

- **Milestone:** 1
- **Estimated duration:** 9-12 months (initial release in 3-6 months)
- **FTE:**  2
- **Costs:** 100,000 USD

| ID | Deliverable | Specification |
| ----- | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | MIT / Apache 2.0 / GPLv3 / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can use our dApp. |
| 0c. | Article | We will publish an **article** that explains [...] (what was done/achieved as part of the grant). (Content, language and medium should reflect your target audience described above.)
| 1. | DApp Setup, Login & Registration | We will setup the DApp, and implement the login and registration capabilities|  
| 2. | User Profiles | We will create the user profile functionality (At this point we will already look to release so we can get users signing up while the rest of the DApp is being built out) |  
| 3. | Company Profiles & Job Search | The job search functionality with job descriptions, and the business side providing them with the ability to post jobs |
| 4. | Company Search & Talent Search | The ability to search for companies and their information, and the ability for businesses to search for talent in the pool|
| 5. | Personal & Business Dashboards | The dashboards for both individuals and businesses|
| 6. | Admin & Settings capabilities | settings, security capabilities and customisation section |
| 7. | Fishtank Admin Portal | design pending but will be needed for Fishtank admins to manage individual/business accounts |
| 8. | Staking | Provided there's legal clarity on this provided with regard to the US market & citizens |

In addition to the above, time will be needed for resolving bugs, testing, and implementing feedback received throughout the development process.

Target initial release date: 3-6 months.
Full implementation: 9-12 months.

Other capabilities - to implement cost/time permitting:

* Goals - nice to have.
* Portfolio - nice to have.
* Dark mode - nice to have.

Our overall goal is to deliver as much as possible for the lowest cost, and within the least amount of time, while ensuring the quality of standard in product associated/known with the Proton blockchain.

Other deliverables:

* Provide initial liquidity needed to have FSH listed on Protondex (FSH:XMD)
* Small investment for supporting marketing initiatives such as a product promo video

Note: Due to the nature of our business, the above milestones/dates are target dates - we need to ensure what we are doing is compliant with labor law and other regulations, and this may increase time with releases. Due to this, as outlined further below, we commit to pushing changes to a staging environment link on a regular basis so progress is visible at all times.

### Future Plans

* We are already working on our new website which is content and community focused - aim is to use this in multiple ways:
 * Drive awareness and adoption of Fishtank, and the overall ecosystem (Proton, Metal, Loan, and other DApps)
 * Generate revenue through subscription tiers and services promoted through the new website (coaching, consulting, resources, etc.)
 * Act as a gateway to the Fishtank Jobs website to bring clients into the ecosystem
 * Promote the DApp through it's development lifecycle and act as gateway to DApp (aggressive marketing channel)

Additionally, we plan to obtain further funding/investment to extend on the value proposition with modules focused on HR/workforce management - VMS, onboarding, core HR, etc. By delivering these we aim to onboard clients on a per employee per month model with costs decreasing based on volume.

While closed source, we do want to open up the project to invite developers into the project to contribute by building modules that can be accessible via a marketplace of talent/work focused capabilities, and later integrations. This would help get the community involved and bring more value to the project.

Furthermore, we plan to launch our own NFT Market dedicated to supporting clients that want to launch campaigns specific to the world of talent and work. We believe NFTs can pay a big role in recruitment campaigns, benefits, loyalty incentives, access, and much more.

Finally, we plan to continue with community engagement, getting involved in Spaces, and working to evangelise and promote the overall ecosystem. Fishtank only does well if the overall ecosystem does well and we pull together as missionaries.

### Longer Term Objectives

Below is an overview of our longer term goals to support our vision and mission - not included within the initial scope:

* Set up small coworking hubs that professionals can access and pay for with their WebAuth wallets
* More integrated financial capabilities for work - compensation, payroll, benefits, etc.
* Multi-year blueprint can be seen here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CaCLR7zQlxgAnA9IOzsAYdNVxXLm4lNI/view?usp=sharing

### Additional Information

> Include work you have already done on Proton Blockchain, are there any other teams or people that have contributed to your project financially, any previous grants you have applied for.

* We have already set up two Metal Blockchain nodes (1 personal, 1 for Fishtank), and plan to become a block producer on Proton
* Contributing to the community by holding Twitter Spaces and being involved to spread awareness and promote adoption
* We are committed to supporting the overall ecosystem - our DApp will include links to other DApps in ecosystem
* No previous grants have been applied for - everything so far has been self funded and we run a tight ship operationally
* No funding raised from the grant will go to Fishtank Labs endeavours (e.g. our company website), only Fishtank
* Developer(s) will initially be onboarded as contractors - FTE roles will have to earn it through outcomes/results


### Governance & Operations

* We plan to buy a license for Canny so we can clearly communicate a dynamic roadmap and capture requests
* Release notes and public facing documentation (API docs etc.) to be added to Gitbook
* From a delivery standpoint, we plan to use the Atlassian technology stack (Confluence, JIRA, etc.)
* If funding is granted, we commit to setting up a staging link so pushed changes can be viewed and progress is visible
* We will also do a monthly demo on progress with the community so feedback can be provided, and questions asked
* Generalised overview of expenditure (high-level due to legal reasons)


### Tokenisation

* Fishtank $FSH - core governance and utility token - max supply: 128m
* Jellyfish $JLY - complimentary governance token to enable voting when $FSH is unavailable (e.g, locked up in staking) - max supply: 1m
* Molly $MLY - fun utility token - a separate token participants can have more fun with later on by voting without introducing risk to the Fishtank token and ecosystem - max supply: 1bn
