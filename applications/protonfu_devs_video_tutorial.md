However since the majority of the code base rely on the EOSIO code base proper proton documentation is missing and new comer are overwelmed by the amount of information he/she have to digest.
Through ProtonFu, the idea is to build a platform that cover the entire proton tooling and library in a .

### Team

Rémy Chauveau (aka RockerOne)
Hi I’m Rémy, a Belgian 40yo kid who works as a digital product manager in a financial company. I love drum and bass dubstep and digital art, I’m in this game for 20 years. 
Formerly a full-stack developer, I started my carer as a graphic and motion designer then slide to development, but I’m always still in love with producing digital art using adobe suite, blender, Ableton Live, and other toys. 
More than one year ago, I started to dive into the blockchain as a developer and find my path as a digital designer in the NFT world and finally find a new position as a Product Manager on a ProtonChain-based project. So Proton is my daily job. 
I’m a one-man band, I do branding, music, illustration, smart contract development, website, and video.
