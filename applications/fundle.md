### Short Description
Fundle is a community building platform to increase customer engagement, benefits and value for both business and members.

We allow businesses to build stronger long-term relationships, offer new customer experiences and gain more out of their community. Our mission is to increase customer engagement, benefits and deliver more value from the community for both business and members.
Each business has its own token to build a digital community and economy. Holders of that token (members) can unlock specific products, NFTs, merchandise, events, experiences, discounts, tokens, access to content or involvement. Community tokens allow businesses to engage with their fans more closely than ever before.

Our token model introduces new ways of customer engagement, benefits, involvement and marketing. Allowing businesses to increase their brand to customer relationship and grow their customer and fan base!

The exclusive digital economy can enable new revenue streams and can be used as an effective marketing tool for businesses. The token model unlocks new ways of customer engagement, benefits, involvement and marketing. Allowing businesses to increase their brand to customer relationship and grow their customer and fan base! The community is rewarded for the value they help creating the business. Members will have social & economic incentives to help the business succeed and the community will grow not only by its members but also in economic value. The tokens stimulate active participation and promotion of the business.


### Project Details

This grant will be used integrate our application and token bonding curve protocol with Proton and to launch the platform. Our team has an ambitious long-term commitment to make Fundle the most popular all-in-one platform for community building, managing, and crowdfunding. 

We see an interesting opportunity in the crowdfunding and community-building market. In these markets involvement and interaction are essential for success. With the entrance of web3, we can strengthen and improve these factors. 

21 million users, $6,8 billion dollars pledged, and 227,000 projects funded. These are Kickstarter's stats and represent only 21.21% of the crowdfunding market, this means a total of 100 million users. Over the last years this market has proven to be a successful formula for funding products. However, there is little involvement, interaction, and control for backers. Furthermore the success rate of crowdfunding can be improved by intensive community building and working together. 

For businesses, the top 3 benefits of an online community are customer loyalty, reduction in support costs and brand awareness. 70% of communities positively affect the brand and company culture. Companies with online communities are 60% more profitable than companies which do not focus on online communities. 

An average member contributes $67 of worth yearly to the community. 33% of organizations with an online community have 10,000 or more members. In the coming years, the social business market will potentially grow with a CAGR of 30.8% to 7 trillion by 2030. Community building is becoming an increasingly important topic for businesses. 

Active participation, involvement, and engagement remains difficult for large businesses. 55% of community professionals find it difficult to consistently engage members when running online communities.  For small businesses building and managing communities remains challenging and a barrier.

These market trends and opportunities form the basis of the Fundle platform. We can revolutionize this landscape by combining the benefits of these markets and blockchain. The way of community building and fundraising needs to be redeveloped to let it reach its maximum potential. We believe that building long-term relationships, involvement and control is essential for this. Our community token model allows businesses to reward members and engage with them more closely than before. The funding mechanism will be democratic and based on voting to release the funds stepwise. We will move towards a heavily interactive environment based on open business participation. The community can help tackling issues and be paid out in tokens.

**Platform status**

We have developed and finished the application and token bonding curve protocol. It is right now running on the Polygon blockchain and the application is already tested on usability and bugs with customers. In the coming weeks we will finetune the application and start with the sales and marketing process. We are planning to launch the platform in the coming months. 

### Ecosystem Fit

**1. Where and how does your project fit into the Proton ecosystem?**

Fundle's potential partnership with the Proton blockchain presents an exciting opportunity to introduce a whole new cohort of users to the world of crypto and Proton. By leveraging the power of Proton, Fundle can showcase what is possible to build on this innovative blockchain by demonstrating the practical value of this blockchain in the real world. With a focus on fostering interaction between members and businesses, Fundle is set to generate a significant volume of transactions on the Proton Blockchain, which will, increase liquidity and volume in the Proton ecosystem. Moreover, Fundle's collaboration with Proton will enable many new and non-crypto users to explore and interact with the Proton ecosystem, including the use of webauth, expanding Protons customer base. With our application ready for launch, Fundle is set to make a significant impact on the Proton ecosystem and beyond

Similar to Protonâ€™s mission, payment accessibility is of high importance for Fundle, and that's why we see Proton as the perfect blockchain to power our platform. Compared to Polygon, Proton offers several benefits for our users, including a streamlined payment process with fiat onramps and no gas fees. With in-app payment requests and verified user accounts, we can simplify and increase the conversion of community token purchases, while minimizing the risk of financial scams and bot activity. By harnessing the power of Proton's high throughput and transaction cost-free architecture. Blockchain technology allows us to revolutionize and strengthen the position of the community with our developed token bonding curve model. 


**2. Who is your target audience?**

**3. What needs does your project meet for the community and what sets it apart from other similar projects?**

The community token model creates new ways of interaction between businesses and members and so new types of benefits and opportunities!

#### For businesses:
From business perspective, much more can be gained from a community (skills, opinions, etc.). An involved and active community will result in loyal customers, a reduction in support costs and an increase in brand awareness and trust. This will positively affect the profit and success of the business.

**Marketing tool**

Tool to build and host community with strong long term relationships with involvement and interaction. The token model stimulates engagement, active participation, promotion and involvement. Fundle can be used to attract new customers and create more engagement within an existing community. More effective marketing than running ads. Businesses can create a digital ecosystem to strengthen brand to customer relations.

**Digital Economy**

Building a digital economy. Business can enable new revenue streams by using Fundle as a sales channel to sell exclusive products, items (NFTs) or merch and profit even more since the community will grow not only by its members but also in economic value. Businesses can determine themselves how they want to utilize the Fundle platform and which types of value or revenue streams they want to enable. The integrated chat eliminates need for external chat channels. Businesses don't need additional communication or sales channels anymore. 

**Offering new experiences**

Ability to offer new types of customer experiences such as digital assets (NFTs) or experiences.

**Community skills**

Access to skills and opinions of the community to grow and improve the business/product. Enables new forms of (user centric) product creation.

#### For members:
Current platforms lack real community involvement and interaction. Members cannot really be "part of" and there is little interaction. Furthermore, both business and members cannot always have fair benefits (social and/or economical).

**Exclusive access**

Access to the community with benefits and rewards in the form of products, NFTs, merchandise, events, experiences, discounts, tokens and acces to content via the groupchat.

**Involvement and interaction**

Involvement and interaction with the business in the form of involvement in the design, testing or development process of products. Interaction via the chat with business updates or discussions and polls about (design) ideas.

**Freelance possibility**

Creatives can do tasks for the community in exchange for community tokens (design, advisory, marketing, etc.). We will move towards a heavily interactive environment based on open business participation.

**Voting**

Democratic fundraising mechanism where members can buy products as pre orders and have control over the collected money. (Mechanism will be included in the future)

#### Uniqueness

To the best of our knowledge there are no similar projects in the Proton or related ecosystems. Compared to other community building platform we are unique. Our token modal and ways of interaction between business and members sets us apart. There is a completely different dynamic on our platform with a social media vibe. Fundle is therefore the perfect all-in-one platform and marketing tool for businesses to get the most out or their community.
