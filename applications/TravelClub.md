### Project Details

We are excited to announce that we have signed a partnership with Expedia to develop a travel website on the Proton Blockchain. 
The Travel Club will be set up as a DAO, with affiliate links, so the community can advertise and be rewarded with tokens when anyone clicks on their post and purchases travel. 
The Travel Club website will offer worldwide hotel stays as well as travel packages, and we will price rooms and vacations in our native token. 
In addition to our native token, users will also be able to purchase travel in any of the top cryptos available on the Proton Blockchain. It will be a crypto-only travel site without fiat options. Stables will be available. 
A portion of the profits from each sale will be distributed to token holders, most likely through a staking bonus. 
A portion of the profits will be distributed to the affiliate partner, and if there is no affiliate partner, we plan to put the tokens into a charity wallet where the DAO can vote to send families on vacation. 

The Domains for this project:
+ TheTravelClub.io
+ TravelDao.io

### Ecosystem Fit

1. Where and how does your project fit into the Proton ecosystem?
>Our goal is to create a global travel presence and to bring the massive crypto and blockchain community over to Proton by introducing them to the WebAuth wallet and fast and free payments. Our site will offer travel at a lower cost than competitors and the community will participate in the growth.   
2. Who is your target audience?
>Our primary target audience will be cryptocurrency holders from all over the world that are interested in travel. Our secondary target will be consumers looking for a better deal in travel, which will give us the opportunity to introduce them to crypto and the Proton Blockchain. 
3. What needs does your project meet for the community and what sets it apart from other similar projects?
>Our site will be the first of its kind on the Proton Blockchain, and we believe we will be able to assist with massive growth and bring in new users to Proton, through the use of the WebAuth wallet. We will accomplish this by delivering a site that appeals to a massive, worldwide audience.

### Future Plans

> How do you intend to enhance, promote and support your project in the future? Our team is full-time and growing. We are builders and we are constantly improving our platforms and adding more services and better functions. We plan to release the Travel Club platform and begin immediately advertising it through paid socials and affiliate links, with the goal of bringing millions of users and mass adoption to the Proton ecosystem.  

### Additional Information

>We are bullish on the Proton and Metal ecosystems and believe in the Metallicus vision. We are actively involved in the Proton community and believe in their vision for mainstream adoption. We currently run 3 metal nodes (4th coming July 1, 2023), run 3 dedicated servers and 2 VPS, and have built a loan liquidator bot. We are actively working on an escrow platform, airdrop platform, a staking platform, and a token creation platform. After The Travel Club, we are building our first of 2 planned national real estate portals and a web3 photography site. 
>We understand the nature of the amount of the grant request and as community members, we understand the hesitancy to give a grant to someone that might then sell this amount of XPR at market. If this is a hurdle to the vote, we would consider using the XPR to either farm or for Proton nodes on the metal chain, depending on when this happens and what is needed. We believe in the future and the growth prospects of the chain, and we believe projects like ours are needed to facilitate the mass adoption of XPR and the chain.
